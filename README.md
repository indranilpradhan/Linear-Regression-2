# Linear-Regression-2

1. Given a dataset containing historical weather information of certain area, implement a linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent to predict the
apparent temperature. The various attributes of the data are explained in the file
description.txt. Note that attributes are text, categorical as well as continuous.
Note: Test data will have 10 columns. Apparent temperature column will be
missing from in between.
2. Compare the performance of different error functions ( Mean square error, Mean
Absolute error, Mean absolute percentage error) and explain the reasons for the
observed behaviour.
3. Analyse and report the behaviour of the regression coefficients(for example: sign
of coefficients, value of coefficients etc.) and support it with appropriate plots as
necessary.
